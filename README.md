The goal of this project is to recreate the Google homepage 
and in doing so train the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that
has been acquired over the last weeks.
Applying the theory in a practical manner by building things
is the best way to test your level, strengths and weaknesses.

I have not used the browser developer tools to look at the 
original code and I had no real problems during the execution 
of this project. The endresult is to my satisfaction.

As a point of criticism I think my code is pretty "messy" and 
most likely I could have reached the same endresult with a less 
lengthy code. I would like to see the code looking more organised.

CSS Grid can be confusing to me, which is why I used it in 
this project to get a better understanding of it.

As a total beginner I am quite happy with the result, generally 
speaking. Although I also think that some very basic things did 
not go fluently enough. Because of this I will do another basic 
HTML/CSS project before continuing the course to Javascript.
